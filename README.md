# WeatherApp

This is a simple, intuitive weather application that shows users weather data based on their current location. In addition to showing the current temperature, this android app also displays the a description of the weather and gives detailed information about precipitation. Specifically, it lets the user know whether it will rain within the next hour and if so, at what minute it will begin raining. This was all powered by the Dark Sky API. The major dev concepts used in this project are HTTP Requests, Geolocation services, and JSON objects.
